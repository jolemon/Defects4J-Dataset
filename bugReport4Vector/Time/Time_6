Questionable behaviour of GJChronology when dates pass 1BC
I expect the following test to pass:
Chronology chronology = GJChronology.getInstance();
LocalDate start = new LocalDate(2013, 5, 31, chronology);
LocalDate expectedEnd = new LocalDate(-1, 5, 31, chronology); // 1 BC
assertThat(start.minusYears(2013), is(equalTo(expectedEnd)));
assertThat(start.plus(Period.years(-2013)), is(equalTo(expectedEnd)));
The error it gives is:
org.joda.time.IllegalFieldValueException: Value 0 for year is not supported
However, I never provided "0" for the year myself. I thought it was the job of the framework to skip over non-existent year 0 for me to return 1 BC?
