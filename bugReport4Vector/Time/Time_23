Â Incorrect mapping of the MET time zone
This timezone is mapped to Asia/Tehran in DateTimeZone. It should be middle europena time.
I know that this bug has been raised before (Incorrect mapping of the MET time zone - ID: 2012274), and there is a comment stating that you won't break backward compatibility to fix this bug.
I disagree that this is a backward compatibility argument
No matter how you look at it, it is a bug.
You could very well state that ALL bugs won't be fixed, because of backward compatibility.
I request again that this bug be fixed.
