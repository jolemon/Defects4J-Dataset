FastMath.[cosh, sinh] do not support the same range of values as the Math counterparts
As reported by Jeff Hain: cosh(double) and sinh(double): Math.cosh(709.783) = 8.991046692770538E307 FastMath.cosh(709.783) = Infinity Math.sinh(709.783) = 8.991046692770538E307 FastMath.sinh(709.783) = Infinity ===> This is due to using exp( x )/2 for values of |x| above 20: the result sometimes should not overflow, but exp( x ) does, so we end up with some infinity. ===> for values of |x| >= StrictMath.log(Double.MAX_VALUE), exp will overflow, so you need to use that instead: for x positive: double t = exp(x*0.5); return (0.5*t)*t; for x negative: double t = exp(-x*0.5); return (-0.5*t)*t;
