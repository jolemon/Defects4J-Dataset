denominatorDegreeOfFreedom in FDistribution leads to IllegalArgumentsException in UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket
We are using the FDistributionImpl from the commons.math project to do some statistical calculations, namely receiving the upper and lower boundaries of a confidence interval. Everything is working fine and the results are matching our reference calculations. However, the FDistribution behaves strange if a denominatorDegreeOfFreedom of 2 is used, with an alpha-value of 0.95. This results in an IllegalArgumentsException, stating: Invalid endpoint parameters:  lowerBound=0.0 initial=Infinity upperBound=1.7976931348623157E308 coming from org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket The problem is the 'initial' parameter to that function, wich is POSITIVE_INFINITY and therefore not within the boundaries. I already pinned down the problem to the FDistributions getInitialDomain()-method, wich goes like:         return getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom() /                     (getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom() - 2.0); Obviously, in case of denominatorDegreesOfFreedom == 2, this must lead to a division-by-zero, resulting in POSTIVE_INFINITY. The result of this operation is then directly passed into the UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket() - method as second argument.
