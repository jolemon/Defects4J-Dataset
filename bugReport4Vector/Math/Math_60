ConvergenceException in NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability()
I get a ConvergenceException in  NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability() for very large/small parameters including Infinity, -Infinity. For instance in the following code:  @Test  public void testCumulative() {   final NormalDistribution nd = new NormalDistributionImpl();   for (int i = 0; i < 500; i++) {    final double val = Math.exp;    try  {     System.out.println("val = " + val + " cumulative = " + nd.cumulativeProbability(val));    }  catch (MathException e)  {     e.printStackTrace();     fail();    }   }  } In version 2.0, I get no exception.  My suggestion is to change in the implementation of cumulativeProbability(double) to catch all ConvergenceException (and return for very large and very small values), not just MaxIterationsExceededException.
