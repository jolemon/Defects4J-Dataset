BisectionSolver.solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial) throws NullPointerException
Method      BisectionSolver.solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)   invokes      BisectionSolver.solve(double min, double max)  which throws NullPointerException, as member variable     UnivariateRealSolverImpl.f  is null. Instead the method:     BisectionSolver.solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max) should be called. Steps to reproduce: invoke:      new BisectionSolver().solve(someUnivariateFunctionImpl, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5); NullPointerException will be thrown.
