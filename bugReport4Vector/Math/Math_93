MathUtils.factorial(n) fails for n >= 17
The result of MathUtils.factorial( n ) for n = 17, 18, 19 is wrong, probably because of rounding errors in the double calculations. Replace the first line of MathUtilsTest.testFactorial() by         for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) { to check all valid arguments for the long result and see the failure. I suggest implementing a simple loop to multiply the long result - or even using a precomputed long[] - instead of adding logarithms.
