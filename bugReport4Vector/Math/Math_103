ConvergenceException in normal CDF
NormalDistributionImpl::cumulativeProbability(double x) throws ConvergenceException if x deviates too much from the mean. For example, when x=+/-100, mean=0, sd=1. Of course the value of the CDF is hard to evaluate in these cases, but effectively it should be either zero or one.
