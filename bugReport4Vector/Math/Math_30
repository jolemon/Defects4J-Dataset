Mann-Whitney U Test Suffers From Integer Overflow With Large Data Sets
When performing a Mann-Whitney U Test on large data sets (the attached test uses two 1500 element sets), intermediate integer values used in calculateAsymptoticPValue can overflow, leading to invalid results, such as p-values of NaN, or incorrect calculations. Attached is a patch, including a test, and a fix, which modifies the affected code to use doubles
