MathUtils.gcd(u, v) fails when u and v both contain a high power of 2
The test at the beginning of MathUtils.gcd(u, v) for arguments equal to zero fails when u and v contain high enough powers of 2 so that their product overflows to zero.         assertEquals(3 * (1<<15), MathUtils.gcd(3 * (1<<20), 9 * (1<<15))); Fix: Replace the test at the start of MathUtils.gcd()         if (u * v == 0) { by         if (u == 0 || v == 0) {
