FastDateFormat getDateInstance() and getDateTimeInstance() assume Locale.getDefault() won't change
The FastDateFormat getDateInstance() and getDateTimeInstance()  methods create the HashMap key from various items including the locale. If the locale is null, then it is not made part of the key, but the stored object is created using the current default locale. If the Locale is changed subsequently, then the wrong locale is applied. Patch for test case to follow.
