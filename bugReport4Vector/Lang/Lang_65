[lang] DateUtils.truncate method is buggy when dealing with DST switching hours
Try to truncate 2004-10-31 01:00:00 MDT by hour and you'll actually get 2004-10- 31 01:00:00 MST, which is one hour after the input hour.     // truncate 2004-10-31 01:00:00 MDT     Date oct31_01MDT = new Date(1099206000000L);         Date result = DateUtils.truncate(oct31_01MDT, Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);     assertEquals(oct31_01MDT, result);
