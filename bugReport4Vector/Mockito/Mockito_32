Mockito can't create mock on public class that extends package-private class
I created simple project to demonstrate this:
https://github.com/astafev/mockito-package-private-class/
Please take a look. Even if it can't be implemented, I think that mockito should throw some normal exception at time of creation.
In my variant on first creation it returns wrong-working mock (invokes real method instead of stubbed). On second creation throws exception that doesn't really connected with problem.
Everything works fine if you mock package-private parent.
