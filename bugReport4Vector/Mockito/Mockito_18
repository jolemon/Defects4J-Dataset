Return empty value for Iterables
http://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=175
I expect an Iterable to be mocked by default with an empty Iterable. I understand from the initial issue this behavior would be introduced in Mockito 2, but beta-8 still returns null.
Could we return null for Iterables ?
Should we have the same behavior for Iterator ?
Thanks
