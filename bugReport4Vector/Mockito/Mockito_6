Argument matcher anyXxx() (i.e. anyString(), anyList()) should not match nulls
This is a bug I'm seeing in 1.10.8 version (older version has the same issue - tested with 1.9.0).
Given:
Function<Object, Integer> function = Mockito.mock(Function.class);
when(function.apply(Mockito.anyString())).thenReturn(1);
Integer result = function.apply(2);
Expected behavior:
result == null;
Actual behavior:
result == 1;
Note that the function is called with an integer (not a string), and still the mocked function return the value which it should return only when a string is passed. The same works when using anyBoolean() or any other methof from any* family.
