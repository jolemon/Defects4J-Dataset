Exception when stubbing more than once with when...thenThrow
If I create a mock and stub a method so it throws an exception and do that twice the first exception will be thrown upon invoking the second stub instruction.
Example:
@Test
public void testThrowException() {
    Object o = Mockito.mock(Object.class);
    // test behavior with Runtimeexception
    Mockito.when(o.toString()).thenThrow(RuntimeException.class);
    // ...
    // test behavior with another exception
    // this throws a RuntimeException
    Mockito.when(o.toString()).thenThrow(IllegalArgumentException.class);
    // ...
}
I can work around this if I do it the other way around with doThrow...when. But I lose type safety then. Can you fix this?
