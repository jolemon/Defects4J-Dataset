Lost a JSC_USED_GLOBAL_THIS warning in 0616 release vs 0514
What steps will reproduce the problem? //------------------  // should warn "JSC_USED_GLOBAL_THIS: dangerous use of the global this object" in both methods  // none of these warns in 0616 release  var NS = {   read: function()   {    return this.foo; // does not warn in 0514 release   },     write: function()   {    this.foo = 123; // warns in 0514 release   }  };    // only the non-inline notation warns in 0616 release  NS.write2 = function()  {   this.foo = 123;  };    //-----------------------  What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Since the 0514 release warned in in the "write" case above I would expect the 0616 to also report this.     What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? As said above, 20100514 and 20100616 releases.    Please provide any additional information below. I understand that the status is that inline-notation isn't preferred, though I wouldn't expect a previous, correct, warning to disappear. (Since I reported issue #144 I'm also aware of the previous limitation in global this).
