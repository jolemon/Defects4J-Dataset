Inconsistent handling of non-JSDoc comments
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. 2. 3. What is the expected output? What do you see instead?   When given:        /* @preserve Foo License */      alert("foo");    It spits out:        stdin:1: WARNING - Parse error. Non-JSDoc comment has annotations. Did you mean to start it with '/**'?      /* @license Foo License */      ^            0 error(s), 1 warning(s)      alert("foo");    If I take the suggestion and change the opening of the comment to '/**', everything is great.  However, if I change it to '/*!', the warning goes away, but it doesn't preserve the comment either.    I expect it to print the above warning, or preserve the comment.  That it does neither when starting with "/*!" (and every other character I tried) is confusing.    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
