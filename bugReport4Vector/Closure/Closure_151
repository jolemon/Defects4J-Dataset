Add a --version option for the compiler.
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Run java -jar compiler.jar --version    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expected: A version statement.  Actual: An error that --version is not supported.    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? See above. This is a compiler.jar I downloaded from this project (didn't   build it myself), file is dated 04/12/2009.  On Windows XP.    Please provide any additional information below. This information doesn't seem to be given anywhere, don't see it on --help   either.    This is an enhancement request, not a bug report.
