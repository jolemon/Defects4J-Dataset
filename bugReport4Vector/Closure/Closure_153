Namespace definition in Prototype is broken
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Namespace definition in prototype.js (Prototype library) looks like:  if (!Node) var Node = { };  2. Compile with latest command line compiler (Version: 20100917 (revision 440) Built on: 2010/09/17 17:55), with default options  3. Open html which uses this script in IE8 - IE will show error message (something like "Node - definition is missing", I use localized version and cannot write exact english message).    What is the expected output?  Something like:  if(!Node)var Node={};    What do you see instead?  Node||(Node={});    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Command line compiler (Version: 20100917 (revision 440) Built on: 2010/09/17 17:55), with default options, OS Linux Mint 7.
