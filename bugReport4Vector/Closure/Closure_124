Different output from RestAPI and command line jar
When I compile using the jar file from the command line I get a result that is not correct. However, when I test it via the REST API or the Web UI I get a correct output. I've attached a file with the code that we are compiling.    What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Compile the attached file with "java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js"  2. Compile the content of the attached file on http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home  3. Compare the output, note how the following part is converted in the two cases:    "var foreignObject = gfx.parentNode.parentNode;  var parentContainer = foreignObject.parentNode.parentNode;"    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The Web UI converts the lines into: if(b){if(a=b.parentNode.parentNode,b=a.parentNode.parentNode,null!==b)  The command line converts it into: var b=a=a.parentNode.parentNode;  The Web UI results in correct code, the other results in code that tries to do "c.appendChild(b)" with c = b (c=a=a.parentNode.parentNode)    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? compiler.jar: v20130411-90-g4e19b4e  Mac OSX 10.8.3  Java: java 1.6.0_45    Please provide any additional information below. We are also using the compiler form within our java code, with the same result.  Web UI was called with:  // ==ClosureCompiler==  // @compilation_level SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS  // @output_file_name default.js  // ==/ClosureCompiler==
