@lends does not work unless class is defined beforehand
What steps will reproduce the problem? With advanced optimizations enabled as well as type checking (--jscomp_error=checkTypes), try to use @lends in the same way it's used on the jsdoc page at http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/wiki/TagLends - using either a utility method called "makeClass" or another method of class constructing such as John Resig's method at http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expected output is to have code compiled but instead I get a compile error such as:    ERROR - Variable Person.prototype not declared before @lends annotation.      What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Latest svn build, OS X.
