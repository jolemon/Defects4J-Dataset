Generates code with invalid for/in left-hand assignment
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Compile this:    window.Foo = function(A, B, C, D) {    if ( A ) {                              if ( B ) {        C = 0;      } else {        C = 0 in D;      }      while ( C-- ) {}    }  }    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?   Expected: Something that doesn't have a syntax error, maybe    window.Foo=function(b,c,a,d){if(b)for(a=c?0:(0 in d);a--;);};    Actual:    window.Foo=function(b,c,a,d){if(b)for(a=c?0:0 in d;a--;);};    SyntaxError: Unexpected token ; (Chrome)  invalid for/in left-hand side (Firefox)      What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?   http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home      Please provide any additional information below.   I noticed this while attempting to minify jquery
