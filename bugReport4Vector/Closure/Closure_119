catch(e) yields JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME warning when e is used in catch in advanced mode
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. set closure for advanced compilation  2. compile this:  // ==ClosureCompiler==  // @compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS  // @output_file_name default.js  // ==/ClosureCompiler==    try {  var x = 5;  }  catch(e) {  var s = "FAIL" + e.name + ": "+ e.message;  }    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I expect no warning or error for this.  Instead I see this:    JSC_UNREACHABLE_CODE: unreachable code at line 4 character 0  catch(e) {  ^  JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME: e is never defined at line 5 character 17  var s = "FAIL" + e.name + ": "+ e.message;                   ^  JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME: e is never defined at line 5 character 32  var s = "FAIL" + e.name + ": "+ e.message;                                  ^  In my case I'm especially complaining about the JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME warning...  Also it seems the unreachable complaint isn't right, but i'm not sure.    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? I'm using this url: http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home  using chrome browser on windows: Version 28.0.1500.95 m   ... but this is a server side error from what I see...    Please provide any additional information below.
