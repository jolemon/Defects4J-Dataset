Redefinition of a function in third party code can be miscompiled
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Run this code snippet and observe that it doesn't raise an error:    function assert(b) {if (!b) throw "error"}    assert(f() === 1)  var f = function() {return 2;}  assert(f() === 2)    function f() {return 1;}    2. Compile it as third_party:  3. Observe that the first definition of f has been changed from an assignment to a declaration, and that the code now raises an error.
