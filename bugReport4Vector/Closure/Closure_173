Operator precedence breaks with certain combinations of *, / and %.
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Try to compile this: x = a % b / b * c * 2; using either simple or advanced optimizations    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?   Expected: probably x=a%b/b*c*2;  Actual: x=2*a%b/b*c; (2 is incorrectly bumped to the beginning)      What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?   Happens on latest version and online. By the looks of things the change occurred somewhere between versions 20111003 and 20111114.      Please provide any additional information below.   As *, / and % all have the same operator precedence they should be left-to-right, but hoisting the 2 to the beginning means it's on the wrong side of the modulus operator.
