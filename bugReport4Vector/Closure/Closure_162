Type aliases cannot be used in type annotations before their definitions
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Compile the following with full warnings:    goog.provide('foo.Foo');  goog.provide('foo.Foo.Bar');    goog.scope(function() {    /**     * @param {Foo.Bar} bar     * @constructor     */    foo.Foo = function(bar) {      this.bar = bar;    };    var Foo = foo.Foo;      /** @type {Foo.Bar} */    Foo.prototype.bar = null;      /** @constructor */    Foo.Bar = function() {};  });      What is the expected output? What do you see instead? This should work, but instead I get an error:    ERROR - Bad type annotation. Unknown type Foo.Bar     * @param {Foo.Bar} bar                      ^    This can be worked around by writing explicitly foo.Foo.Bar, but this leads to strange inconsistencies in the code before vs. after the alias definition.      What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? r1346 in Linux    Please provide any additional information below.
