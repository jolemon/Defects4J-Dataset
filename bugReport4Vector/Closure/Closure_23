tryFoldArrayAccess does not check for side effects
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Compile the following program with simple or advanced optimization:  console.log([console.log('hello, '), 'world!'][1]);    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The expected output would preserve side effects. It would not transform the program at all or transform it into:    console.log((console.log("hello"), "world!"));    Instead, the program is transformed into:    console.log("world!");    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Revision 2022. Ubuntu 12.04.    Please provide any additional information below. tryFoldArrayAccess in com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants should check whether   every array element that is not going to be preserved has no side effects.
