Invalid left-hand side of assignment not detected
What steps will reproduce the problem? Compile this:    var x=0,y=1;x||y=8    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I expect an error, because this is parsed as (x||y)=8, which is an invalid left-hand side of an assignment. Instead, I get    var x=0,y=1;x||y=8;  which, like the input, is invalid code.
