Bug with labeled loops and breaks
What steps will reproduce the problem? Try to compile this code with the closure compiler :   var i = 0;   lab1: do{       lab2: do{           i++;           if (1) {               break lab2;           } else {               break lab1;           }       } while(false);   } while(false);     console.log(i);     What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The generated code produced is :  var a=0;do b:do{a++;break b}while(0);while(0);console.log(a);     Which works on all browsers except IE (Looks like IE doesn't like   the missing brackets just after the first do instruction).    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? I am using the version of Jun 16 (latest) on ubuntu 10    Please provide any additional information below. Strangely, this bug doesn't happen when I use PRETTY_PRINT formatting option.
