Cannot exclude globalThis checks through command line
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Run command line utility  2. Supply flags --warning_level VERBOSE --jscomp_off globalThis --jscomp_off nonStandardJsDocs    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I expect that globalThis and nonStandardJsDocs warnings will be ignored. Only nonStandardJsDocs warnings are ignored.    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Version 1180  Sun OS 5.10    Please provide any additional information below. --jscomp_error also doesn't work with globalThis (works with nonStandardJSDocs).
