goog.scope doesn't properly check declared functions
The following code is a compiler error:    goog.scope(function() {    var x = function(){};  });    but the following code is not:    goog.scope(function() {    function x() {}  });    Both code snippets should be a compiler error, because they prevent the goog.scope from being unboxed.
