\0 \x00 and \u0000 are translated to null character
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. write script with string constant "\0" or "\x00" or "\u0000"    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I expected a string literal with "\0" (or something like that)  and instead get a string literal with three null character values.    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? compiler-20110119.zip on windows 7 x64    Please provide any additional information below.   This is causing an issue with IE9 and jQuery.getScript. It causes IE9 to interpret the null character as the end of the file instead of a null character.
