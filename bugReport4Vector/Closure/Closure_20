String conversion optimization is incorrect
What steps will reproduce the problem?   var f = {    valueOf: function() { return undefined; }  }  String(f)    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?   Expected output: "[object Object]"  Actual output: "undefined"    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?   All versions (http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/ as well).    Please provide any additional information below.   The compiler optimizes String(x) calls by replacing them with x + ''. This is correct in most cases, but incorrect in corner cases like the one mentioned above.
