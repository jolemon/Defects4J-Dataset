--language_in=ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT results in 1 'use strict' per input file
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1.  Create a JS file called "get_num.js" with the contents "var getNum = function() { return 5; };"  2.  Create a JS file called "alert.js" with the contents "alert(getNum());"  3.  Compile the two files with the following command:    java -jar compiler.jar --language_in=ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT --compilation_level=ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --warning_level=VERBOSE --js get_num.js --js alert.js    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?   I would expect the output to be:    'use strict';alert(5);    or, if the compiler wants to be really clever, just "alert(5)" since this is already ES5 Strict compliant.
