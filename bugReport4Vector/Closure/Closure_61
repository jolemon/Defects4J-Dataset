Closure removes needed code.
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Try the following code, in Simple mode  Math.blah = function(test) { test.a = 5; };  var test = new Object();  Math.blah(test);   2. The output is  Math.blah=function(a){a.a=5};var test={};      What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Note that Math.blah(test) was removed. It should not be. It issues a warning: JSC_USELESS_CODE: Suspicious code. This code lacks side-effects. Is there a bug? at line 4 character 9    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Tested on Google hosted Closure service.    Please provide any additional information below. Closure seems to be protective about Math in particular, and doesn't like people messing around with her? So, when I try the following code:-  var n = {};  n.blah = function(test) { test.a = 5; };  var test = new Object();  n.blah(test);    It works. When I replace n by Math, then again, Closure kicks out blah. I need that poor fellow. Please talk some sense into it.
