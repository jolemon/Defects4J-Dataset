Incorrect output if a function is assigned to a variable, and the function contains a variable with the same name
What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. Enter the following into the online compiler      var foo = function bar(){      var bar;      alert(bar)    };     2.  Compile using simple optimization    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?    I'd expect to see      var foo = function() {      alert(void 0)    };     Instead I see      var foo = function bar() {      alert(bar)    };    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?    Using http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home    Please provide any additional information below.    The compiled output is correct if you remove the "var foo =" part, or if you rename the function from "bar" to something else.
