@enum does not type correctly
What steps will reproduce the problem?   1. create an enum with any syntax  my example:  /**   @type {Object}  */  var NS = {};    /**  @enum {number}  */  NS.keys = {    a: 1,    b: 2,    c: 3  };    /**  @enum  */  window['gKEYS'] = NS.keys;      2. complie with --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --summary_detail_level 3 --warning_level VERBOSE    3. look at the % typed    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? it shouldn't count the enum as un-typed; it does...    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
