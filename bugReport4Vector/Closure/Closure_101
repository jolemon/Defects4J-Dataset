--process_closure_primitives can't be set to false
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. compile a file with "--process_closure_primitives false"  2. compile a file with "--process_closure_primitives true" (default)  3. result: primitives are processed in both cases.    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The file should still have its goog.provide/require tags in place.  Instead they are processed.    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? current SVN (also tried two of the preceding binary releases with same   result)    Please provide any additional information below. Flag can't be set to false due to a missing "else" in the command-line   parser.
