closure-compiler @define annotation does not allow line to be split on 80 characters.
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1.  Create a JavaScript file with the followiing:  /** @define {string} */  var CONSTANT = "some very long string name that I want to wrap " +                 "and so break using a + since I don't want to " +                 "introduce a newline into the string."  2.  Run closure-compiler on the .js file.  3.  See it generate an error on the '+'.    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? It should work, since the line is assigning a constant value to the var.    Please provide any additional information below. Removing the '+' and making the string all one line does work correctly.
