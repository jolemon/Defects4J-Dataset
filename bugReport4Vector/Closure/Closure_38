Identifier minus a negative number needs a space between the "-"s
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Compile the attached file with      java -jar build/compiler.jar --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --js bulletfail.js --js_output_file cc.js  2. Try to run the file in a JS engine, for example           node cc.js    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?   The file does not parse properly, because it contains      g--0.0    This is subtraction of a negative number, but it looks like JS engines interpret it as decrementing g, and then fail to parse the 0.0. (g- -0.0, with a space, would parse ok.)    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?   Trunk closure compiler on Ubuntu    Please provide any additional information below.
