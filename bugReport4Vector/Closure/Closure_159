Closure Compiler failed to translate all instances of a function name
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Compile the attached jQuery Multicheck plugin using SIMPLE optimization.    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? You expect that the function preload_check_all() gets its name translated appropriately. In fact, the Closure Compiler breaks the code by changing the function declaration but NOT changing the call to the function on line 76.
