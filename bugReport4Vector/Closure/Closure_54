Prototype methods can't be used from the constructor in case prototype is explicitly defined.
Consider the following source code:  http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/inspector/front-end/DOMAgent.js    When I mark WebInspector.DOMAgent as a @constructor, I get the following warning.    Source/WebCore/inspector/front-end/DOMAgent.js:48: WARNING - Property _setAttributesPayload never defined on WebInspector.DOMNode          this._setAttributesPayload(payload.attributes);    It sounds like the problem is in the way we define prototypes in line 83-ish. That's the way WebKit style tells us to do.
