$super is replaced when it should not be replaced
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Have javascript using prototype's $super  2. Compile with advanced_optimizations  3. See that $super is replaced by for example $super$$4    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? $super should not be renamed as it is used by prototype.    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Latest from svn.    Please provide any additional information below. Personally I made a quick fix in MakeDeclaredNamesUnique.java line 79:  if (t.getCompiler().getCodingConvention().isExported(name)) { continue; }  This fixed it for me, but not sure if that's the right place or method to  solve this, as I am unfamiliar with the project.
