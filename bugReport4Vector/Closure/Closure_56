Last warning or error in output is truncated
The last error or warning statement written to the output appears to be getting truncated. It's causing a problem for my error / warning parser.    To reproduce, create a file called test.js and add the following content to it:    ---------------  alert(foo);  alert(bar);  ---------------    When compiled, the output looks like this:    ---------------  >java -jar compiler.jar --warning_level VERBOSE --js test.js  test.js:1: ERROR - variable foo is undefined  alert(foo);        ^    test.js:2: ERROR - variable bar is undefined    2 error(s), 0 warning(s)  ---------------    If you look at the last error includes neither the line the error occurred on nor the column-indicating caret. This happens with warnings as well.    Tested against r1257 committed 2011-07-11 11:11:32 -0700.
