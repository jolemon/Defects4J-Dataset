Dependency sorting with closurePass set to false no longer works.
What steps will reproduce the problem?   1. Instantiate new instance of Compiler    2. Set closurePass to false to prevent goog.require/goog.provide removal.  compilerOptions.setClosurePass(false);    3. Turn dependency sorting on.  DependencyOptions dependencyOptions = new DependencyOptions();  dependencyOptions.setDependencySorting(true);    4. Compile js code      What is the expected output?   Dependent files should be sorted and concatenated in their dependent order.    What do you see instead?  Dependent files are not sorted.    What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? > r1824  mac OS 10.7      Please provide any additional information below. This worked in the r1810 release. However, it looks like this was changed in r1824. The compiler now expects closurePass to be true for dependency sorting to work.  http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/source/detail?path=/trunk/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/Compiler.java&r=1824    What we are looking for is a way to sort dependencies and concatenate all files in their dependent order without removing the goog.require/goog.provide js calls. Turning closurePass to true causes the goog calls to be replaced. We use this methodology in local development to test our JS code.    Thanks!
