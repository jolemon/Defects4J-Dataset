Optimisation: convert array.join(",") to array.join()
What steps will reproduce the problem?   Compile this code:    var variable = confirm("value from user");  var array = [ "constant", variable ];  alert( array.join(",") );      What is the expected output? What do you see instead?   $ java -jar /usr/local/slando/lib/Google/compiler.jar --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --js foo.js  var a=["constant",confirm("value from user")];alert(a.join(","));    We could save three bytes here by producing:    var a=["constant",confirm("value from user")];alert(a.join());      What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?   $ java -jar /usr/local/slando/lib/Google/compiler.jar --version  Closure Compiler (http://code.google.com/closure/compiler)  Version: 1180  Built on: 2011/06/15 21:40    Running on Linux 2.6.18      Please provide any additional information below.   Here's a common pattern this would be useful in:    var my_jquery_selectors = [];  // ... append to my_jquery_selectors from various parts of the codebase ...  $(my_jquery_selectors.join(",")).html("the code is more readable with the comma left in place");
